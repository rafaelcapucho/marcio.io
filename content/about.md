Hello World,

I started to learn about programming when I was only 12 years old, self-taught, before I studied and graduated in Computer Science. Over the last 13 years I have been working on
increasingly complex projects, mainly related to Distributed Systems, Web Crawlers and Servers, that way I gained a lot of experience with Big Data and Infrastructure.

Over the last 13 years, I have been working with more than 20 languages, since 2008 mostly wih Python.

Beyond the fact that I am a backend architect I would say that I do both, my awesome frontend toolkit is composed mostly by ReactJS and SCSS.

From lead developer to companies around the world, programing has no barriers.

That is it for now,
Thank you!
